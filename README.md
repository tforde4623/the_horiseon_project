The goal of this project was to "refactor" code to a given website. In order to do this I did a couple things:

1. Go through the html code and rename some tags, to semantic tags in order to better organize it for others developers
and for screen readers. Some examples would be headers, footers, nav section, articles, main sections, sections, asides.

2. Go through and add some tags (specifically some section tags grouping the articles in the document).

3. Change a little css for some of the changed tags (pretty much just the nav elements)

4. Organize the document more by adding breaks in code (line spacing).

5. Making sure all the links worked, and linked stylesheets and pictures.

6. Commented css
